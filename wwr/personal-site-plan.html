      <h3>Christmas pearl</h3>
      <p>
        There could be products related to themes that always occur every year, such as Christmas, Halloween, etc. These products with these themes could look amazing and awesome to our eyes. These products could be a good and fun thing to decorate our place with the respective theme. Although Christmas is coming now, I wanted to make a website with the products related to this theme. The products, and crafts made of pearls, could be pearl candles, boots, hanging balls for the tree, etc. All these products would be related to the Christmas theme.

      <h2>
        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        On this wireframe, there is the header, which has the logo and links. And we can see the banner with the headline in its center. Moreover, I was thinking of putting more details and more descriptions with the images at the side about the true purpose, the specific materials the products and the prices. And make the little box saying: "BUY NOW!" to click on it. And finally, the wireframe contains the footer which there would be the other links about social media, including a little description about the page at the side.
